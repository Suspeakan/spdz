# СЫПЕҖ

СЫПЕҖ is a conlang by me, Suspeakan. The conlang was made in summer of 2023 and is one of my most developed and documented languages at the time of writing this, another more developed conlang of similar stature would be Jorophos. It started by being an amalgamation of various languages such as; no I'm not kidding: Hakka, Russian, Greek, Dutch and Finnish. Eventually it forged its own identity, that definately seems "slavic" in aesthetics, which was one of the goals which appeared early on.

This СЫПЕҖ project has couple of files attached with various uses. Currently, these files are:

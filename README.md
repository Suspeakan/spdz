# СЫПЕҖ

СЫПЕҖ is a conlang by me, Suspeakan. The conlang was made in summer of 2023 and is one of my most developed and documented languages at the time of writing this, another more developed conlang of similar stature would be Jorophos. It started by being an amalgamation of various languages such as; no I'm not kidding: Hakka, Russian, Greek, Dutch and Finnish. Eventually it forged its own identity, that definately seems "slavic" in aesthetics, which was one of the goals which appeared early on.

This СЫПЕҖ project has couple of files attached with various uses. Currently, these files are:

## Glossing

In pages with glosses, I use a variation of the leipzig glossing rules, it should be obvious any differences, if you know it, but one thing will stand out. When I gloss a nominalized participle, that being a verb turned into a noun, like "нэц содҳой-ко", I will gloss it as such:

    {нэц содҳой-ко}ₐ
    {PTCLPN₁ farm-PTCPLN₂}(farm)ₐ

Each participle will be marked with a subscript letter, from A-Z, and for more than that:
     
     z (26), 
     aa (27),
     ab (28), 
     ac (29)...
     bb (54), 
     ca (79), 
     ef (136)...
     zz (702)

and the two parts of the nominalization, the particle and the suffix (ҳой, including <-ко>) are labeled as PTCLPN₁ and PTCPLN₂. Below, in the English line, the meaning of the nominalized participle is inside ().

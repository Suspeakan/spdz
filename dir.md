  (Context: A ~1960s USSR poster of a cosmonaut smiling, with the side of his hand on his brow (like blocking the sun to see something clearer, a gesture of looking intently for something (usually acompanied by squinting)). Behind him is his spaceship and space, on his helmet an initialism reads "СССР", which is the Russian initialism for "Союз Советских Социалистических Республик" (in English, the "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics", USSR). Below is the top of a Russian Orthodox church and (presumably) a mosque, with the spires, apexed with crosses and crescents, visible. Original text read "Бога Нет!", meaning (most likely...?) "There is no god!", the exclaimation, taken with the pose of the cosmonaut, and the Marxist (that being Communist) attitude to religion, is a statement of Atheism, the cosmonaut went to space, and found no god, as he would have expected (which is perhaps why he is so gleeful).)
